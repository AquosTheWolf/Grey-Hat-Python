# Grey-Hat-Python
a Python3 port of the Grey Hat Python book written by Justin Seitz.

This Repo is a port of the book written by Justin Seitz from py2 to py3. The original source code has errors which need to be corrected, and I will correct those after I have successfully ported it to py3. I will add the py2 code in the appropriate folder named py after I have finished the py3 because it's not easy managing py2 and 3 on one system.
